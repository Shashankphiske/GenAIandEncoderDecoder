What encoder decoder architecture does?
Encoder Decoder architecture is a sequence to sequence architecture. 
It consumes sequences and spits out sequences

How does it do it ?
first the encoder stage creates a vector representation of the input sentence
then the decoder stage creates a sequence output

Encoder :
A recurrel neural network encoder takes each token in the input sentence one at a time and produces a state representing these tokens as well as all the previously ingested tokens
then the state is used in the next encoding step as input along with the next token to produce the next state 
Once you are done ingesting all the input tokens into the RNN you output a vector that essentially represents the full input sentence.


decoder :
The decoder takes the vector representation of the input sentence and produces an output sentence
